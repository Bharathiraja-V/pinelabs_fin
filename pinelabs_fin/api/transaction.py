"""Core state machine for Pinelabs Transaction.

This module is the *only* place that writes Pinelabs Transaction rows
or creates Payment Entries. terminal.py / plural.py / webhook.py all
delegate to the helpers here so the state-transition rules and
Payment-Entry guard rails stay in one place.

State machine (enforced by both this module and the doctype controller):

    INITIATED ──▶ PENDING ──▶ SUCCESS
        │            │
        │            ├──▶ FAILED
        │            └──▶ CANCELLED
        │
        ├──▶ SUCCESS    (Terminal: response → success without PENDING)
        ├──▶ FAILED
        └──▶ CANCELLED

Payment Entry creation rules (from PHASE_1_PLAN §8):
  1. Created only from mark_success() in this module.
  2. Skipped if a PE with the same reference_no already exists.
  3. Skipped if the transaction already has a payment_entry linked.
  4. Built via erpnext.accounts.doctype.payment_entry.payment_entry.get_payment_entry.
  5. mode_of_payment / reference_no / reference_date / remarks set explicitly.
  6. PE name is written back to the transaction; status flipped to SUCCESS.
  7. Wrapped in one DB transaction; rollback on any error.
